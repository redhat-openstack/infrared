Anyway, from https://rhos-ci-staging-jenkins.lab.eng.tlv2.redhat.com/view/DFG/view/df/view/deployment/job/DFG-df-deployment-17.1-virthost-2cont_2comp-lvm-ipv4-multiple-overcloud/ the override seems to be propagated into the virt templates, problem is though virt2 templates are not log collected - I\u0027d consider adding these into the IR\u0027s collect-logs plugin code also.",
