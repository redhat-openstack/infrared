      "message": "Hi Luigi,\n\nThis was part of Ade\u0027s original patch but he is at a conference at the moment. I think the reason for moving the validate call was we are changing the dns server setting in the /home/stack/virt/network/network-environment.yaml in the new set_overcloud_dns.yml are and we want to validate that that file is there before trying to change the DnsServers setting from 10.0.0.1 to the ipa controllers 10.0.0.x ip.\n\nThis code path gets run in two situations tripleo-overcloud with \"--overcloud-use-dns-names yes --overcloud-ssl yes\" or tripleo-undercloud and tripleo-overcloud run with \"--tls-everywhere yes\"",
