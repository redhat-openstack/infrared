I think that is fair. If we land this first, updating[1] for the new file and forcing reviewers to go over the XL-sized patch is not necessary. Instead a separate follow up patch to update only this file to align with changes in [1] would make sense.\n\n[1] https://review.gerrithub.io/c/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/530083",
