      "message": "I wonder, shouldn\u0027t this be conditionalized for older OSPds rather than using single version for all rally deployments from now on, as this seems to be needed only from Wallaby above? Its true that the rally gate on OSP13 is passing, but except that there might be consequences bumping away cirros from the version OSP13 deployment ran for years, introducing now rally deployments to be testing smth different than previous extensive non-rally testing was done...\n\nI\u0027d prefer older releases sticking to what they were running on top for the whole lifecycle (assuming 0.4.0), but as ultimately that decision is on rally users, I don\u0027t want to block this.",
