      "message": "is it really needed to propagate to facts?\nthey are kind of global scope, and polluting them with local variables (esp ones with generic name as os_version) seems risky, if done just for debugging purpose, maybe it would be better to just print them out here?",

      "message": "adding here a digest of discussion from irc: the os_version as a global fact is a bad one - I agree - will work on it, the reason I made these facts instead of being vars it\u0027s fairly essential info when it comes to comparing jobs from json file (generated by collect-ansible-facts) between two runs of the same job or two different job runs (i.e.: if the problem is why one run was way slower than the other we can compare the sources the images were downloaded from so we need these facts)\n\nand I do understand this all sounds like debugging info but to me facts are relativelly small compared to logfiles and we should save as much as we can of them about each job run so we have a more complete picture when we look at them in jenkins or , more preferably, in CI web portal",
