I added https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-extra/issues/15 but I do not have time write the patch myself.\n\nStill, injecting the cleanup code in tox is extreamly easy, look at https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-extra/blob/main/src/tox_extra/hooks.py#L14 -- mainly you only need to add another function called `tox_runtest_pre` and to the cleanup there.",
