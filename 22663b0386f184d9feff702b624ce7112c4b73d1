      "message": "Pavel, how about adding a new feature to tox-extras that does that? I added https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-extra/issues/15 but I do not have time write the patch myself.\n\nStill, injecting the cleanup code in tox is extreamly easy, look at https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-extra/blob/main/src/tox_extra/hooks.py#L14 -- mainly you only need to add another function called `tox_runtest_pre` and to the cleanup there.",

      "message": "@Sorin ... Pavel mentioned something about multithreded execution of these tox environments and possibility that some threads may start to cleanup things whic are still being used by other threads... while such bash\u0027y cleanup should account for that for sure as well... I\u0027m more referring to your proposal about pre_test hook, probably worth considering multithreaded execution (especially temp/random workspaces etc.)...\n\nre using your hook proposal here in this tox-pycache ... sure why not... just need to have it in the python3-tox rpm first ;-)",
