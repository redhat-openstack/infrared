      "message": "There are better ways to prevent surprises from updated test dependencies, like pinning them and updating them manually using pip-compile.\n\nOne repository that does that is https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint/blob/master/test-requirements.txt -- which is a pin that works as a constraint. Is not build by humans, but there is a tox job that updates it, you call it when you want to bump them. The source on is the requirements.in which contains the relaxed versions, which is human controlled.\n\nPing me next week if you need an more help: hint: once implement it assures that when you run twice, it does run with same deps, regardless what goodies were pushed to pypi ;)",
