# The following structure used for the hybrid deployments,
# where Undercloud and Controllers are virtual, Computes baremetal
# and the networks are bridged outside of the local hypervisor host.
# The separation of the networks are the following:
# * br-ctlplane - used for provisioning
# * br-ex-and-int - used for OSPd internal services (internal/external/tenent api)
# * br-link - used for dataplane networks
