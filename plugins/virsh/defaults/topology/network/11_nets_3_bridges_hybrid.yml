# The following structure used for the hybrid deployments,
# where Undercloud and Controllers are virtual, Computes baremetal
# and the networks are bridged outside of the local hypervisor host.
# The separation of the networks are the following:
# * br-ctlplane - used for provisioning
# * br-internal - used for OSPd internal network flow - Control/Data plane
# * br-external - used for OSPd external network flow - External api/FIP
