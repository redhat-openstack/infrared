                        normal - use RPM version of Tempest (the usual way Tempest is ran)
                        debug_failing - installs tempest patches with highly experimental
                            features (i.e.: run_on_failure) that are not yet merged to
                            main Tempest project. See https://review.opendev.org/#/c/553896/
                            for more details.
                            Tested only on OSP12 and above.
                        debug_all - an extended version of 'debug_failing' but running
                            debugging/info capturing commands on _all_ tempest tests.
                            Useful when troubleshooting resource leaks and other problems
                            not directly related to tempest tests failures.
                            Use with caution (i.e.: only with small test suites) as it consumes
                            build time and disk space considerably.

                        refspec option may be necessary to specify the ref containing the SHA-1.
