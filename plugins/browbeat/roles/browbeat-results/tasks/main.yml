# (akrzos) Port 9000 is already in use by zaqar-server with Newton and thus the fact that likely the
# user will choose a port that is not enabled by selinux to allow httpd to listen, we need to modify
# the ports enabled by selinux for httpd.  If the port is already defined you will run into this
# issue if you use the "seport" ansible module:
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2694
