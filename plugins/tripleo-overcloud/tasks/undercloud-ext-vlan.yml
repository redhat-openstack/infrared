# In BM deployment case we need to masquerade overcloud's external network
# traffic thru UC node which is also BM node. Such traffic is in this
# case closed in VLAN and we don't have access to the that network on UC.
# First we need to enable masqurading for external network with undercloud.conf's
# "masquerade_network" setting for each infra. Then following role will add
# interface connected to external network using same cidr as ExternalNetCidr.
# These two cidr's must match!
# On hypervisor we don't need such tweak as external traffic is handled by libvirt.
