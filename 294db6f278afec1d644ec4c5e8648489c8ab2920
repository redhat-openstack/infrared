      "message": "Luigi, we had enabled srbac for 17.0 but didnt stickily set to enforcing for the scope of things. I added this extra template so we can leave our 17.0 unified job going like before but this one would be for 17.1 to further tighten down srbac in 17.1. Im not opposed to combining things in one template but was trying to allow both paths.",
