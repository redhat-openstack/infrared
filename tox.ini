# ANSIBLE0002: Trailing whitespace
#   There should not be any trailing whitespace
# ANSIBLE0004: Git checkouts must contain explicit version
#   All version control checkouts must point to an explicit commit or tag, not just "latest"
# ANSIBLE0005: Mercurial checkouts must contain explicit revision
#   All version control checkouts must point to an explicit commit or tag, not just "latest"
# ANSIBLE0006: Using command rather than module
#   Executing a command when there is an Ansible module is generally a bad idea
# ANSIBLE0007: Using command rather than an argument to e.g. file
#   Executing a command when there is are arguments to modules is generally a bad idea
# ANSIBLE0008: Deprecated sudo
#   Instead of sudo/sudo_user, use become/become_user.
# ANSIBLE0009: Octal file permissions must contain leading zero
#   Numeric file permissions without leading zero can behavein unexpected ways. See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/file_module.html
# ANSIBLE0010: Package installs should not use latest
#   Package installs should use state=present with or without a version
# ANSIBLE0011: All tasks should be named
#   All tasks should have a distinct name for readability and for --start-at-task to work
# ANSIBLE0012: Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing
#   Commands should either read information (and thus set changed_when) or not do something
#   if it has already been done (using creates/removes) or only do it if another check has a particular result (when)
# ANSIBLE0013: Use shell only when shell functionality is required
#   Shell should only be used when piping, redirecting or chaining commands (and Ansible would be preferred for some of those!)
# ANSIBLE0014: Environment variables don't work as part of command
#   Environment variables should be passed to shell or command through environment argument
# ANSIBLE0015: Using bare variables is deprecated
#   Using bare variables is deprecated. Update yourplaybooks so that the environment value uses the full variablesyntax ("{{your_variable}}").
# ANSIBLE0016: Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
#   If a task has a `when: result.changed` setting, it's effectively acting as a handler
# ANSIBLE0017: become_user requires become to work as expected
#   become_user without become will not actually change user
