      "message": "tagging command in general works. It depends on which command you are using in the tagging playbook called in the task because nova and heat are not part of the undercloud anymore. for example openstack server list will fail but metalsmith list will give a similar output, also \"openstack baremetal node set \u003cUUID OR NAME\u003e --property capabilities\u003dprofile:\u003cPROFILE\u003e\" will also work so tagging in general is possiable and mostly depends on the other commands and modules used in the playbook.",
