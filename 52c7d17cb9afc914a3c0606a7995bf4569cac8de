I\u0027m open to suggestions tho\n\nif we can\u0027t find any good one soon then we\u0027re going with this a big ugly one to get things going ... we may talk to reldel/phase3 DFGs if merging support for ECDSA an other ssh keys in tempest in osp16.1/13 may be something we would do as downstream only patch and part of RPMs (not an expert if that\u0027s something that is possible at the moment)",

But this is an internal discussion, nothing to say here.\nIn any case the patch as it is depends on an internal patch, so at most you may want to add the diff as a file to IR and apply it, not downloading some stuff from somewhere.",
