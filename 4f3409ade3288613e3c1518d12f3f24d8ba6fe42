      "message": "I may seems to be especially picky on this point, but:\nthe commit message should reflect the \"why\" the changes are happening.\n\nI can see that a template is removed (you wrote \"unused\", that\u0027s good), but then why are the other templates renamed and their definitions changed? Do they need to be distinguished somehow? Why can\u0027t the same template be used for both? That\u0027s the thing that should go in this commit message. As a reviewer I don\u0027t have enough information to judge whether the change makes sense or not if I just look at the commit message.\n\nI may have pointed out this many times, but the subsections of the following documents explains it in a better way that how I could have said it:\nhttps://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how\nhttps://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages\n\nPlease note the latter is *not* openstack specific, it just happen to have been drafted by openstack people\n",
