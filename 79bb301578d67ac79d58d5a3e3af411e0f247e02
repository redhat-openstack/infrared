      "message": "I don\u0027t think this method of rendering roles_data files is sustainable for the long term. We already provide a bunch of defaults in tripleo-heat-templates that could be used:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/tree/master/roles\n\nIMO, we should instead copy the roles files from the defaults when using composable roles. If you believe there is a composable role not covered by our defaults, and you would like it included. I would suggest that we instead look at adding it to the THT defaults.\n\nWhile this change addresses the removal of some services, I have almost certainly missed some of the additions that should now be there. Maintaining this system would require input from all DFG\u0027s as tripleo-heat-templates is a multi discipline repo maintained by all interested parties.",
