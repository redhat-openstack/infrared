      "message": "Hey, so I think this can be done in a better way. You can use dnf state list and look for \"present\" instead of installed, and do same as task for yum. \n\nI know that there is no \"installed for dnf module\" but intalled\u003dpresent, the attributes do the same.\n\nThe reason is that, the libvirt_status can take error output(from the ansible_pkg_mgr module) and the virsh will pass this task, as the length is greater than 1.",
