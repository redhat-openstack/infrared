      "message": "I am trying to deal with the --prefix feature where Infrared uses prefix for all its resources i.e. prefix-$name (for networks, vm names, ...), so all the names have prefix followed by dash and then whatever the name of resource is.\nhttps://github.com/redhat-openstack/infrared/blob/master/plugins/virsh/tasks/load_topology.yml#L17\nI can possibly add additional condition to check if prefix is defined If It is defined then we can set as profile name whatever is between first and last dash.\n\nGenerally I am just trying to unblock myself and progress with OSP17, not really trying to rewrite Infrared so any suggestion or patch is welcome.",
