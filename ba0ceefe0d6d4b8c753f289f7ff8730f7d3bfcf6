      "message": "It should affect older versions.\n\nI\u0027m not aware about any reason why it should not be pinned (imo pinning was default in our codes since beginning, but it was made optional with some changes in past and i would assume it was never put here to be done explicitly).\nAs there is afaik no update/upgrade run with packstack, and even if, then it should be from explicit to explicit puddle, not relying on out-of-scope non replicable external changes across time.",
