      "message": "ok, thanks Luigi.\n\nAs a suggestion, I think it would be great to merge this[0] change as long as --plugin PLUGIN is a valid argument because now when using this --plugin \u0027https://\u003ccode_repo3\u003e,\u003csha-1|branch|tag|FETCH_HEAD\u003e,refs/changes/xx/yyyyyy/zz\u0027 the character in position version[osp_version] of \u003csha-1|branch|tag|FETCH_HEAD\u003e is taken as version. Merging that change the version set will be properly interpreted (the whole string) for default (all) OSP version. \n\n[0] https://review.gerrithub.io/c/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/546223",
