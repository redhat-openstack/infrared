      "message": "Yes, they are. As automated gating can not be used in multirhel case, at minimum the third one serves as a necessary gate replacement (V+1 vote).\n\nIf its about the \"internal\" link sharing in general, I don\u0027t want to go into the questionable discussion of what can or can not be shared \"outside\", because that would let into questioning why we use gerrithub at all in the first place. All in all these links are critical proof of work related to this review (which is also work-tracker, same as e.g. jira) connected to the majority of work being done and vpn and infosec concerns are really not relevant here.",
