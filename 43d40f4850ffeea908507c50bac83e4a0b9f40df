      "message": "Yes, they are. As automated gating can not be used in multirhel case, at minimum the third one serves as a necessary gate replacement (V+1 vote).\n\nIf its about the \"internal\" link sharing in general, I don\u0027t want to go into the questionable discussion of what can or can not be shared \"outside\", because that would let into questioning why we use gerrithub at all in the first place. All in all these links are critical proof of work related to this review (which is also work-tracker, same as e.g. jira) connected to the majority of work being done and vpn and infosec concerns are really not relevant here.",

If we don\u0027t trust our security measurements and teams, considering gerrithub (comments) serious threat (btw. the URLs to the gates are here too), we should stop using it and move the reviews internally then, and not rather killing the on-point comments/discussion and increasing misunderstandings by moving relevant data to external tracker that has nothing to do with the review process itself (and then explaining people read this specific external comment xyz and match it with this gerrit patchset comment abc, that would be contra-productive at least).",
