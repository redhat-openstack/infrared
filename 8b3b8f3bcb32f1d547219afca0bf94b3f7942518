      "message": "i would recommend longer delay here, to not make potential network congestion situation even worse with asking proxy caches to do more requests in parallel\n\nmaybe something in scope of 30-50% of what this task usually takes, to have better chance at recovering from network-too-slow situation\n\n(although such approach is good ONLY for the \u0027Operation too slow\u0027 or similar cases, not for 404/500 or such responses, so likely removing the \"is not failed\" condition and instead have just the \u0027too slow\u0027 one there [and if then add later explicitly other conditions in which we could even assume that retry may helps])",

      "message": "1. longer delay time - DONE - see inline comment in next patchset (it\u0027s based on a successful installation of the packages as I couldn\u0027t find how long is a \u0027too slow\u0027 situation)\n\n2. re the \u0027is not failed\u0027 - it should stay as the \u0027until\u0027 condition, the reason is:\nuntil: \"yum_install is not failed or not yum_install.msg | regex_search(\u0027Operation too slow\u0027)\"\n\nthat means the task will finish (success or failure) if any of the two conditions are met, in a situation when yum still throws \u0027operation too slow\u0027 messages (i.e.: for the first mirror or attempt it tries) but later on it success then the \u0027yum_install is not failed\u0027 condition will be met hence the task will not be retried\n\nhope it makes sense",
