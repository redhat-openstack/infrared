It is not clear why we would implement this change if that is the current standard.\n\nI know Filip has been working on updating the nodes to RHEL 8.6 in a rhos-qe-jenkins patch so perhaps he should comment on the intended future for CI nodes.",

      "message": "First of all, let\u0027s determine why we should use RHEL7 on 16.X environments where we have RHEL9. Also, OSP17 is based on RHEL9 so libvirt should use optimization for RHEL9 instead of RHEL7. Ideally this should be configured based on osp version. At the same time RHEL 8.7 as well as RHEL 9.1 don\u0027t have \u0027rhel7\u0027 so we cannot use this type if OS for libvirt tuning if we are planning to use RHEL8.7 or RHEL9.1",
