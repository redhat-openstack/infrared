      "message": "Giving a +1 contingent on enable-stf.yml not being used. Also, I\u0027m acknowledging that this still doesn\u0027t meet what Leif asked for - that there should be an immutable base configuration and the CEPH config should be separate from that. At this point, having watched the discussion, I\u0027m convinced it will be faster to merge a version of this, get it working, and then fix it to be how we want.",

      "message": "I agree and understand Leif\u0027s desire to split the templates and now it\u0027s the closest to what he requested. It\u0027s obviously makes sense when you administrator and  want to deploy STF but when you have to test 3 different OSP versions with 4 different clouds 2 different ceph configurations and 2 different gnocchi configurations it\u0027s quite a mess. So since splitting the file is not carrying ANY functional meaning but only for convenience purpose I\u0027d like to avoid creating additional templates since we have too many already.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this file is usable until Wallaby, so using it with OSP13/16 is likely to cause problems. Our documentation for OSP 13/16 totally ignores this file in favor of putting all the options in the docs and telling the user to make their own file. The intention is that in 17+ this file will have a proper base config that the user will then customize with an stf-connectors added on top.\n\nI can\u0027t tell from here whether this is getting included in any tests or is just for future use, but if it\u0027s being included I think that\u0027s a problem.",
