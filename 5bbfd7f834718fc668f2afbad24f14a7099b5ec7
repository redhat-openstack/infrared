      "message": "Giving a +1 contingent on enable-stf.yml not being used. Also, I\u0027m acknowledging that this still doesn\u0027t meet what Leif asked for - that there should be an immutable base configuration and the CEPH config should be separate from that. At this point, having watched the discussion, I\u0027m convinced it will be faster to merge a version of this, get it working, and then fix it to be how we want.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this file is usable until Wallaby, so using it with OSP13/16 is likely to cause problems. Our documentation for OSP 13/16 totally ignores this file in favor of putting all the options in the docs and telling the user to make their own file. The intention is that in 17+ this file will have a proper base config that the user will then customize with an stf-connectors added on top.\n\nI can\u0027t tell from here whether this is getting included in any tests or is just for future use, but if it\u0027s being included I think that\u0027s a problem.",
