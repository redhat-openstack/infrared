      "message": "this (using hypervisor instead of undercloud) suppose to be only a workaround to get the osp17 rhel9 phase1+2+3 jobs working, long term we wanted to go back to using undercloud as vbmc host (after a few things about osp17/rhel9 repos would be sorted) ... https://review.gerrithub.io/c/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/535530 is a workaround for the osp17/rhel9 would be the preferred workaround (in future we\u0027ll remove it when \u0027rhos-release\u0027 tool will be providing us with the correct URL) - please chime in this other change",
