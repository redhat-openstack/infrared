      "message": "Tripleo doesn\u0027t create the file at the moment. However I talked James Slagle and he pointed me to new upstream change https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/+/817816 , which is going to solve the problem. Taking that into considerations I encourage you to comment on the upstream patch to help move it forward. I\u0027ll close this change in favour of upstream change, unless somebody think we need this change as well.",
