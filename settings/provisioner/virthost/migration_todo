1time virthost setup
====================

to extract virthost setup to single individual place
as atm it is spread all across virsh & installer playbooks
it needs to be done in two steps:

1) new virthost provisioner created (describe virthost expectations in one place)
2) deprecated/announce need to use virthost provisioner on clean machine once, before using virsh
3) remove parts of code for virthost configuration from virsh & installer completely

After step 1 user would be expected to use:

  ir-provisioner virthost --host-address=some.fqdn --host-key=$HOME/.ssh/something [--host-user=cloud-user]


... at least once, after clean (re)installation of system (or on major change of virthost requirements)

Though it could be also integrated (later?) into virsh provisioner itself,
maybe even as option (e.g. --openstack-virthost, default on?).
