This patch, if updated per most recent review, could support that.\n\nQuoting our conversation from 2 weeks ago:\n\n\"\"\"\n$ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e initial-ceph.conf\n[global]\npublic_network \u003d \u0027172.120.3.0/24,172.117.3.0/24,172.118.3.0/24,172.119.3.0/24\u0027\ncluster_network \u003d \u0027172.120.4.0/24,172.117.4.0/24,172.118.4.0/24,172.119.4.0/24\u0027\nms_bind_ipv4 \u003d true\nms_bind_ipv6 \u003d false\nEOF\n$ openstack overcloud ceph deploy \\\n  --config initial-ceph.conf \\\n  ...\n\nSo... I think we need a subsequent IR patch so that we can pass any\narbitrary initial-ceph.conf .\n\nSo IR could have conditional jinja where if an initial-ceph.conf was\npassed as input to IR, then it includes it with the --config option to\nrun a command like the above. You\u0027d then keep your own copy of\ninitial-ceph.conf for your job and pass it to IR.\n\"\"\"\n",
