      "message": "Looking at the several post-oc stages and plugins, also to r-q-j repo, I see widespread use of explic--explicit \"deployment-files\" parameter being used in direct form or parametrized by IR_TRIPLEO_OVERCLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_FILES...\n\nThough it might be benefical to have the dir linked, not sure whether there is demand to do so, therefore if there is potential adoption from plugins using it. Also one negative comes to my mind, introducing this would make the \u003ctemplates\u003e dir somewhat hidden/assumed variable, maybe forcing people of using \"deployment-files\" might be safer approach, forcing deployment stages (and often new people building jobs from these, parameter by parameter, stage by stage) to be build compatible to each other explicitely.\n\nNo strong opinion overall, if there are use-cases a potential adoption forthcomming, then ff to ignore this.",
