      "message": "I wonder whether is this change necessary, as with RelDel we agreed the - to _ tag will happen only since specific build for 17 far before we had working content, so we cant consider the old \"-\" way for 17 can be discarded as is.\n\nDoes this send a message that there is a plan in future to do so with older and released OSPs? I hope not. If not then:\n\nI prefer original format since it strictly assumes something about the agreed format of input file for certain OSP which is better for catching bugs and accidents in the container*yaml file, rather that just trying \"any of possibilities\", which can theoretically lead to hiding such mistakes/bugs.",
