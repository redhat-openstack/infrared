      "message": "Again, here you are referring to the undercloud machine. The idea was to remove that reference and work only with local files. \n\nSo scenario should be next: \n1) Look into the profile folder {{ invnetory_dir }} and check if we have overcloud_deploy.sh file there. \n2) If yes for 1), then copy it to the undercloud and use. \n3) If not for 1) then use ~/overcloud_deploy.sh from undercloud (this setep is options)\n\nThis approach will require fetching of the overcloud_deploy scrip from the undercloud prior running that upgrade plugin.\n\nBut I\u0027d suggest to ask about that Tal, wether we need to use that approach here",
