The job will still fail, but the user will be able to debug it.\nRight now everything falls apart when this command fails, which means that you don\u0027t even know if there is just one faulty files or more of them.\nThe idea is to collect as much debug as possible (i.e. all the subunit files). Everything will still fail, but with more data.",
