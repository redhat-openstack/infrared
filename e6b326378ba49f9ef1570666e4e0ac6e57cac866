      "message": "In current situation i think it will be hard to do it, for two reasons.\n\n1. We need to use other than openstack-tripleo package, and i tried with openstack-tripleo-common and openstack-nova. These packages are available from more than 1 repo, so it will be hard to find the right one.\n\nExample: http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/486433\nThe test was done with ocata\n\n2. The repo files is called rhos-release-rdotrunk-*.repo or delorean-*.repo, but the repo is only \"dolorean\", so we can\u0027t extract the version of repo name. Example:\n\nhttp://pastebin.test.redhat.com/486440",
