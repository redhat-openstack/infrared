Imho we should do it selectively for OSP17 only, likely on CI layer (?), or not at all and try to adjust deployment framework to lower the requirement to meet the 4GB limit - if not, then this requirement should be made public and reflected in docs first - as this will not be requirement for OSDs or ceph itself, since this is part of OC provisiong, it will be requirement from TripleO.",
