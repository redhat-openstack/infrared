      "message": "Hey Luigi,\n\nThanks again for taking a look. I can see there is a composable roles job that runs as part of the integration testing on this patch. Just wondering if you had an example scenario you were concerned about as I can see that job has passed?\nhttps://rhos-ci-jenkins.lab.eng.tlv2.redhat.com/job/gate-infrared-tripleo-composable-roles/1221/\n\nIf there is a specific scenario that you were thinking of, I can test that out as well and make sure any changes I\u0027m making here also cover that use case.\n\nIf it\u0027s easier, we can have a quick Google Meet to discuss?",
