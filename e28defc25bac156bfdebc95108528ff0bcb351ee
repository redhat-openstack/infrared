      "message": "We encountered a problem using SR-IOV CI job with FDP repo and OSP17, one of the recommendations in the BZ [1] was to use sync command, in order to prevent race conditions, to be sure all writes to images are inserted to persistent storage, before other calls to virt-* commands which change the image happen, or before the image is uploaded to glance.\n\nI will elaborate more in commit message about the problem this patch is meant to prevent.\n\nPlease let me know if it seems better, if anything else is missing.\nThanks\n\n[1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d2121504",

      "message": "most of people don\u0027t go to gerrit and stroll thru comments to find out the links to the issue this code is fixing, the commit message should have enough information for people to be able to track down the tangible reason for this change, bz link in commit message would be a good start - NOTE this change will affect (probably no harm but nevertheles) all people in CI... not just one or two DFGs, hence change should be easy to understand and get more info on it - via commit msg that is\n\nbtw. I\u0027ve kicked the failed gate-infrared-virsh-master job again for patchset5, it\u0027s best to \u0027retrigger\u0027 individual (failed) jobs in jenkins master instead of recheck... not sure if regular users have the permissions for it tbh but if yes then that would make the gating passing faster",
