In the normal workflow the key is created here so normal users won\u0027t notice any issue, but if it was explicitly added maybe people want to use that one.\n\nDoes it work with 13 and 10 as well? I think it would be safer to set it based on the version of RHEL to be deployed, but I\u0027m not sure we have that information in the virsh plugin.",
