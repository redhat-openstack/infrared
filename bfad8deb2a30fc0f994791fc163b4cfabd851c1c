See [3] and [4].\n\n1: https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conf_ref.html\n2: https://linux.die.net/man/5/yum.conf\n3: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/issues/456\n4: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/pull/465\n\nSo, the question is then why this failure is happening in the first place.
