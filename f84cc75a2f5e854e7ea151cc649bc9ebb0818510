I think we can simplify that and in case of any conflicts and so on just fail the command. \nAlso I think it would be good to support checkout of refspecs (gerrit patches) and specific commits.  \nAll that is optional and can be discussed.  \nI worked on that some time ago. Maybe this can be helpful: https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/388414/",

      "message": "Thanks Oleksii, \nPlease see my comments below:\n- Extra branch: If you think we should remove this I\u0027m fine with that. The reason I kept it is because it was there before and I didn\u0027t want to change the behavior that existed before.\n\n- Pull: I think we do need to pull. Usually, you install infrared on your computer and that\u0027s it. The plugins have old branches, so if you don\u0027t pull you will not be able to sync your branch with changes from origin.\nFor example, if I have an old version of a plugin with 2 branches, now I want to change from master to some other branch I would expect the \"update\" command to actually perform the update.\n\n- Support checkout of gerrit patches - This is actually a good idea but in my opinion, we should implement it in a separated patch since it is not directly related to this fix.",
