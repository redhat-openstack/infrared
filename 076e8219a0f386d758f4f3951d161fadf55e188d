      "message": "I have trouble understanding the change and also motivation here, also finding the right part in Jira. Do I understand correctly that in the prefixed case, there was separate data network previously? Is it know why was that? As such change sounds pretty-targeted, so it likely had a pupruse...\n\nAnyway, ow, the prefixed deployment and \"normal\" one are deployed the same way?\n\n(assuming this doesn\u0027t count with multiple deployments on the node, its just about a different type of deployment - prefixed one)",

      "message": "Explained by background chat+updated commit message:\n\ntkorol:\nWhat was initially planned for the prefix deployment - is that its data and external networks are deployed with IPs 192.168.14.0 and 10.0.10.0 (hence 14 and 0 in net_list and data_net_list) - so there could be two deployments per single machine. It was implemented in virsh and undercloud install - but not in overcloud, in overcloud it is pretty much hardcoded that networks should be 192.168.24.0 and 10.0.10.0. Since it is not in use at all (didn\u0027t find single usage in rhos-qe-jenkins repo) I decided to reuse it - since it required only minor intervention into the code. If needed  - we can always restore and improve this functionality, but right now it is working for me",
