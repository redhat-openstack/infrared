Do I understand correctly that in the prefixed case, there was separate data network previously? Is it know why was that? As such change sounds pretty-targeted, so it likely had a pupruse...\n\nAnyway, ow, the prefixed deployment and \"normal\" one are deployed the same way?\n\n(assuming this doesn\u0027t count with multiple deployments on the node, its just about a different type of deployment - prefixed one)",
