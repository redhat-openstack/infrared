      "message": "it could be a bit misleading for a first-time-reader of this option as the machines were not only pre-provisioned but also prepared (i.e.: images download already, etc.) - is there an official tool or documentation (of tripleo, openstack or whatever) that you have used to provision/prepare the machines before hand? ... it would be great if we could drop some URLs here so we show which exactly use case (hopefully some official) is supported here... if it\u0027s not official then we either make it one or put a bit of more info how the machines haves to be provision/prepared so we could have this workflow covered - I\u0027m happy to help with this (reviews + code)",
