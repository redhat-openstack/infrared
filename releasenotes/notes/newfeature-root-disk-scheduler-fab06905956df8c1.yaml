    Some nodes might use multiple disks. This means the director needs to
    identify the disk to use for the root disk during provisioning.
    There are several properties you can use to help the director identify it:

        * model
        * vendor
        * serial
        * size
        * etc

    This feature allows to configure root disk for a multi-disk nodes.
    Example::

        --root-disk-override node=compute,hint=size,hintvalue=50
        # will set a root disk to be a on a device with 50GB for all compute nodes

        --root-disk-override node=controller-1,hint=name,hintvalue=/dev/sdb
        # will set a root disk for controller-1 to be /dev/sdb
