That might make debugging difficult as system state will not be final in the end.\n\nIf we need to have packages installes from special repo, I prefer to have such repo permanently added to system repos otherwise it will be \"a mess\" when we need to debug the flow manually.\n\nI prefer to stay with lines #39-43 previously removed to be enabled when deploying 7-9.",
