      "message": "This is example why I believe value should not be part of plugin.spec - as as \u0027quickly\u0027 as condition and some specific size was added, it may be found out condition need expanding or specific size changing according to new findings, new ci jobs, or further/future osp changes.\n\nAs such it should be as much contained inside infrared as possible - while external explicit param passing being used only in exact complicated situations.\n\nE.g. now it can do 10GB by default, and jparker can override it for some specific jobs where it\u0027s known it needs to be bigger. But once way for properly detecting those is established (if even possible here, as it may depend on type of tests which is not known in this plugin) code to transparently handle it can be added here too and no need for param overrides on CI/user level.",
