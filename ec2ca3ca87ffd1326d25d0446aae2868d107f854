      "message": "Thanks, this is useful - but I don\u0027t know if we would need to add vlan to NeutronNetworkType in order to use it, which is the goal here.\n\nI guess there was a time when vlan was not part of the default, which led to https://review.gerrithub.io/c/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/485851\n\n\nI agree we shouldn\u0027t change those files too much, but then wouldn\u0027t it make sense to read the value of the two parameters and only change it if \"flat\" is not in the list? I know you explicitly excluded that route but I\u0027d play safe, even if the code is going to be complicated.\n\nBut this really requires input from network people.",
