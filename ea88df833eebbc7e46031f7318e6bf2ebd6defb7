As *root*, create the directory:\n   # mkdir /var/lib/tftpboot/ppc64le\n\n2. As root, change the ownership to the appropriate UID/GID:\n   # chown 42422.42422 /var/lib/tftpboot/ppc64le\n\n3. As root, ensure the SELinux label is correctly set:\n   # chcon system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0 /var/lib/tftpboot/ppc64le\n\nResult: Step 4 (openstack overcloud image upload...) may now be executed.\n",
