      "message": "Luigi, from what i can tell the current runs will key in on \"not import\" and the tar extension is used even when hardend-uefi-full is in use. the full, hardened-uefi-full, and hardened-uefi-fips-full images are all tar files inside the rpm so we dont want to skip the tar extension for any use case except from outside import.  if im missing a use case please let me know.",
