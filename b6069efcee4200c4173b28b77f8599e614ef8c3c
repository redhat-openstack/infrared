      "message": "Conditional imports of playbooks is very bad form in Ansible. What it ends up doing is adding the condition onto every task in the playbook, and mention has been made that this functionality will be removed in the future.\n\nTo make it both more efficient, and work in a supported way, I\u0027ve use a condition in the hosts parameter of the playbook instead.
