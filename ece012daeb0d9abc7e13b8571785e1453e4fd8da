      "message": "(FTR: historically, imho the prefixed deployment feature was lead this way to introduce deployment separation and therefore multiple simultaneous virthost deployments on single baremetal. As libvirt could not do that itself, the single solution was to do it without libvirt\u0027s knowledge - prefixing libvirt resources, vm names, subnets, etc. and separating them manually on the subnet level, so they coudln\u0027t interfere with each other. This feature was unfortunately never finished. This fix cancells the initial work on such direction so there are no obstacles later in the usual deployment.)",
