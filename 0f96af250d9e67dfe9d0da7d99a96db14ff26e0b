      "message": "Generally I think this is good,\nbut when changing virt/network/baremetal_deployment also fix it for composable roles generated case (it will replace the virt/ static file later).\n\nPossible approach:\n- similarly as growvols playbook is applied in https://github.com/redhat-openstack/infrared/blob/master/plugins/tripleo-overcloud/tasks/generate_baremetal_deployment.yml#L19\n- detect the condition for workaround and inject the playbook in same way (seems they can be named like Controller.sssd_selinux.yaml (only part before first dot applies as role name)\n- we should append all playbooks for same role(s) in https://github.com/redhat-openstack/infrared/blob/master/plugins/tripleo-overcloud/files/generate_baremetal_deployment_from_roles_data.py#L206 instead of replacing?",
