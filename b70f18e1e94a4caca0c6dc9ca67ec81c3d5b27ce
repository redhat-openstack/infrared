Maybe use \u0027nova list\u0027 on the undercloud to get the controllers?\n\nNote also that with containerized deployments /etc/manila/manila.conf on the controller host will no longer be the active configuration.  /etc/manila/manila.conf in the manila-share container will be reflected as /var/lib/config-data/manila/etc/manila/manila.conf.  Other OpenStack components will also follow this pattern - there\u0027s nothing special here about manila.  But that\u0027s of course an OSP13 thing since manila, cinder, and neutron are still uncontainterized by default in OSP12.",
