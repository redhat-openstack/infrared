See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Literal_IPv6_addresses_in_network_resource_identifiers\n\nThe cert subject name, I think it needs to match?\nBut ideally the cert subject name would be a dns name like: \u0027foo.clouddomain.example.net\u0027, and a subject alternative name using IP type should be in the cert to allow using the ip address as well as the name?",

I did quick cherrypick, but unfortunately it seems like this did not fix the problem http://rhos-ci-logs.lab.eng.tlv2.redhat.com/logs/rcj/phase2-17.0_compact-director-rhel-8.4-virthost-3cont_1comp-ipv6-vlan-lvm-ssl/19/undercloud-0/home/stack/overcloud_install.log.gz .\n\nMaybe I should try to prepare live deployment where we can investigate deeper? Are there any more suspected places where this might be comming from?\n\nIn current state, if it doesn\u0027t fix the main issue, but it has potential to break other p2 deployments (gates passed, right, but they are limited and not yet OSP17 based), I prefer not merging (yet).",
