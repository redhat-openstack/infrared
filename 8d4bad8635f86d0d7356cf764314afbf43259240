I thought this is how Tempest with latest ostestr we want to run nowadays everywhere?)\nand second for\n7|RPM|\u003c0.8 ? (2 - is this really true?)\n\nThat doesn\u0027t make sense for me, please explain.\n\nad 2) suite 7 will be run inly for RPM setups still having not os-testr updated? How is that possible as IR ensures we have ostestr updated to latest version?\n\n3) I thought we want to run RPM everywhere from now.\n\n4) I would like to remove whole task \"run tempest \"{{ test_suite }}\" suite 7\" as it is not needed anymore to unify  once and for all how Tempest is deployed for all RHOS releases, with exception:\n * that we want to maintain backward compatibility for a while (I am not against, just questions above needs to be answered, we can remove it as part of RHOSINFRA-1183 later.",
