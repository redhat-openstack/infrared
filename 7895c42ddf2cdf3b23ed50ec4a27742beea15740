      "message": "As far I know, bm jobs need to provide their own manually constructed instackenv file using the --instackenv-file argument. But I\u0027ll ask Filip to take a look on that. \n\nOVB uses it own template for the instackenv file (instackenv-bmc.json.j2) and host vars saved by the openstack provisioner. So I think OVB will not be affected. BTW ovb nodes in our setup currently does not have OS installed \u003d). So should be fine there + gate has passed. \n\nWe have a separate task to collect information about ovb nodes in the similar way we have it here: https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RHOSINFRA-1117",
