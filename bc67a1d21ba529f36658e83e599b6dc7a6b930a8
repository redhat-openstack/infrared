      "message": "I just wonder now, is there any downside of distro? AFAIK It has no dependencies other than standard library, so maybe this file can be just kept as follows:\n```\nimport distro\nif \u0027rhel\u0027 in distro.like().split():\n    from infrared.core.utils.selinux_fix import copy_system_selinux\n    copy_system_selinux()\n```\nThe only flaw I can see is missing support for py26 with this. Any thoughts?",
