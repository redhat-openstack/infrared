      "message": "The reason to make the change is not clear. It looks like we\u0027re updating the tool, but adding a bunch of exceptions. This makes it seem like it\u0027s not an improvement. It would be good to mention if follow-on patches are coming to address the exceptions, and to action those follow-on patches to show how we get back to a small, limited number of exceptions which are justified.",

      "message": "What does improve mean? limiting ansible-lint to old version is not good practice.\n\nThere are 2 strategies at least. First one, get a new version of tool (which is this patch about), add to exclude all new checks it introduced, then create cards/bugs to fix the checks that were excluded. In this case, when check is fixed, the developer will remove the check from exclusion list and CI will show what actually fixed.\n\nThe second approach is to get new ansible-lint locally, find and create cards/bugs for all checks, fix, then introduce a new version of ansible-lint. This way is more roady, as the work cannot be shared properly. All developers will need to install/use ansible-lint, they won\u0027t be able to test/CI as old version of ansible-lint doesn\u0027t detect issues. So, blind merges, and fixes later on.\n\nThis patch is first step in first approach. If you have a strategy that is different please let me know",
