      "message": "This is by design and this logic seems to apply for other openstack projects as well. A make install command is not supposed to target a virtualenv. If one is active, it would use it. Few weeks back I tried to add venv to Makefile on another project and got rejected.\n\nI think that the logic is: tox for venv, Makefile for non venv. Ok to call tox from Makefile but probably not the other way around. Makefile is more of a multi-purpose tool. \n\nHere is one example: https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/blob/master/Makefile\n\nBy not specifying target we allow enough flexibility to make it work for all cases: it would for as root, it would work for non root (including MacOS), if user wants to specific targets they can change behaviour using pip config or PIP environment variables.\n\n--user by default would break on many platforms due to multiple causes: wither python would fail to load the user packages or even more common, package would install but the CLI script will not be in path.",
