      "message": "I was having a look at what these task/upgrade/upgrade.yml does, and it is basically the very old set of tasks used to upgrade the undercloud before OSP10, which it is not supported anymore: https://review.gerrithub.io/plugins/gitiles/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/refs/heads/master/plugins/tripleo-undercloud/tasks/upgrade/upgrade.yml \nAnd it was mostly removed because when upgrading the undercloud with install.cdn set to true, this block of tasks was getting executed too, updating undesired packages (https://review.gerrithub.io/plugins/gitiles/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/refs/heads/master/plugins/tripleo-undercloud/tasks/upgrade/upgrade.yml#44) and running the undercloud upgrade comman (https://review.gerrithub.io/plugins/gitiles/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/refs/heads/master/plugins/tripleo-undercloud/tasks/upgrade/upgrade.yml#85) which should occur in tripleo-upgrade invokation, not here.\nIMHO, I believe this block of tasks can be removed out of the picture.",
