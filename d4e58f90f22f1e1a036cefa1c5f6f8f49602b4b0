Or use as timeout parameter of the wait_for module. \n\nAlso the help message \"Number of seconds to wait before checking connectivity to the host after rebuild\" for wait argument in the pluign.spec no longer represents the real logic.",

      "message": "I agree about \u0027when: provision.wait \u003e 0\u0027, thanks, I will fix that in next patch. Concerning documentation, it\u0027s valid as you may find mgmt_strategy in foreman_provisioner module. So foreman_provisioner module will sleep for provision.wait before starting pinging the node. But once it was rebuilt, pinged, we don\u0027t need to wait on ssh as foreman_provisioner already assured the reboot/connectivity.",
