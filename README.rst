What is InfraRed?
=================
 dummy

InfraRed is a plugin based system that aims to provide an easy-to-use CLI for Ansible based projects.
It aims to leverage the power of Ansible in managing / deploying systems, while providing an alternative, fully customized,
CLI experience that can be defined by anyone, even if he/she doesn't know what Ansible is.

The project originated from Red Hat Openstack infrastructure team that looked for a solution to provide an "easier" method
for installing Openstack from CLI but has since grown and can be used for *any* Ansible based projects.
