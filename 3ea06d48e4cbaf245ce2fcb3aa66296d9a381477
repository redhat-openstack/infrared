      "message": "Indeed it\u0027s tight to a \u0027regular composable\u0027 architecture(3controllers + 3db + 3rmp + 3ceph + 2networker + 2computes). Some roles have just 3 ips cause we have just 3-node clusters(5+ are out of scope)\nIMHO having files as is is better cause they would be added automatically when \u0027--predictable-ips yes\u0027 is specified, leaving \u0027--overcloud-templates\u0027 as a fallback for override.\nIf majority agrees that it\u0027s better to pass with \u0027--overcloud-templates\u0027 - it\u0027s not a big deal to move those files.",
