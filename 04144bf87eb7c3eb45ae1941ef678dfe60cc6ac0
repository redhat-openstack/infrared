      "message": "Nope, no JIRA - just me being a little frustrated at seeing the gates fail often during cleanup of any resources in an OpenStack environment.\n\nAnd yeah, async is meant as a fire-and-forget mechanism. IMO this change still allows it to fail overall if any individual task fails, but gives it more chance to succeed on the individual tasks.",
