      "message": "My suspicion is that would be cause by changed commit message (only commit, no files), as afaik gates are not triggered by \"just commit\" change, though previous active builds still might be cancelled by it, as it is a new patchet anyway, so new commit-only patchset won\u0027t trigger new gates, but cancels previous ones?\n\nI see this weird behaviour being set for a long time, maybe its time to reevaluate. I suspect the https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/triggers.html#triggers.gerrit \u0027s \"exclude-no-code-change\" might be the reason. Not sure.\n\nLet\u0027s JIRA it FTR: https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RHOSINFRA-4055",
