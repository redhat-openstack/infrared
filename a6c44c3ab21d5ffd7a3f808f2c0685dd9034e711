IIUC, after applying your change each job that used the old implementation should be additionally adjusted somehow, right?

      "message": "No, all the point is that old jobs should continue to work as before. \nThe plan is that the patch enables to set up custom third octete in prefixed jobs - while if no custom value is set, Infrared is using default values (so it should behave the same way as before the patch). I just want to test whenever it is working as designed.",
