      "message": "do you need to use stat? isn\u0027t it logically known by now which one is there (i mean the tasks would fail already if copying fails) ... so if, then at most you need just set_fact and calculation based on the \u0027instack_file_path.stat.exists || ~/instackenv.json\u0027 ... as that is what previous tasks you are adding says (if not exists, do copy from inventory or fail)\n\ni wonder why we even copy provided-by-user file into different file name (as provided by user) instead of always into instackenv.json, could there exist more then one file? if we could have the name unified on UC side imo",
