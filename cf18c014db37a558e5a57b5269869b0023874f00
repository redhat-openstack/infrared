How do we track the number of support exceptions on certain versions on a regular basis?\n2. How do we ensure that we have a representative test in place to verify a working state for those exceptions?\n3. What would the CI jobs be used for wrt the exceptions?\n\nTo my mind, the CI jobs shouldn\u0027t be necessary. We can save a representative build as an image set and that set can be used by support or dev teams for support purposes. The image sets can be built via CI, or by hand.",
