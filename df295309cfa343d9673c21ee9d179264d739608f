If you think it belongs here I can update it too.\nThe purpose of my patch was to address the Network DFG jobs mainly which only use the controller and compute roles but you\u0027re right. Let me know what you think.",

      "message": "Daniel, the both patches are actually self-contained and can be merged separately, in any order. I just noticed that storage nodes templates in three-nics-vlans remain using br-isolated and some osp13 ceph-related deployments failed with this patch when Arie started some additional jobs to test. \nIn my composable_roles patch I modified all available templates (not only compute and controller nodes). Not sure if this was necessary, probably also need to run additional tests, with storage nodes.",
