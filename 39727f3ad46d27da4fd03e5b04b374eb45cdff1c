      "message": "Such approach doesn\u0027t sound right to me. Do we really want to disable one of major services to allow all traffic rather than setting allowed traffic? Sounds to me like disabling selinux rather than adding few rules...\n\nJust wondering, are there any docs on this in relation with TripleO? I\u0027d assume firewalld rules should be part of OC deployment (for LB node) if it is deployed from the scope of Tripleo...",
