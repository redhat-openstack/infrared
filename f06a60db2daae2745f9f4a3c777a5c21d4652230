      "message": "Hey, the only supported hypervisor qemu config is the one provided by RHEL-8.6 (http://rhos-qe-mirror-brq.usersys.redhat.com/infrared/slaves.html#preparing-a-slave) as that is the single (latest) supported version of for the whole IR stack. The bump is not planned since IR is being replaced by next-gen so RHEL-9.x hypervisor env will not be likely ever supported.\n\nIs this change backwards compatible with RHEL-8.6? If it\u0027s not then this has to get -2.",
