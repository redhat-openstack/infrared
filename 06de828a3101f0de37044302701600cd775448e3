      "message": "This is part of the BZ#1537806 implementation where the final workflow runs \u0027openstack tripleo container image prepare\u0027 as part of the overcloud deploy command(the command still runs but it\u0027s run automatically via a workflow and not manually by the operator as it\u0027s currently in Infrared). I don\u0027t think we should not adhere to the new workflow just because it \u0027seems risky\u0027.\n\nIn the case you\u0027re mentioning re-running the upgrade command after fixing the root cause should get the stack moving forward. If that is not the case then it\u0027s a bug in the product and it should be investigated accordingly.",
