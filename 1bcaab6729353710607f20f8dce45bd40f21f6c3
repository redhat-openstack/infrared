This will set this fact for each \u0027undercloud\u0027 group host so that in theory if one is RHEL8 and the other RHEL7 then each will get the right interpreter... although I don\u0027t think there\u0027re any use-cases for multiple hosts in this group anyway. It\u0027s an improvement, regardless. :)",
