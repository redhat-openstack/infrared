      "message": "You only need to run openstack tripleo container image prepare prior to deploy in the case where you are running ceph deploy before overcloud install. By default the overcloud deploy process will run this at deployment time so this the condition is that this needs to be run before ceph deployment.  I\u0027m uncertain why the ovn conditional was ever used for this. It might have been to ensure they get the correct containers into the docker-images.yaml which shouldn\u0027t have been used since the `openstack tripleo container image prepare` went live in OSP14 (I think it was 14).",

      "message": "Unfortunately, also looking into git history, this is fine example of IR spaghetti-ness. Some job did not work, someone extended mentioned conditional for their use-case to make it work, others copied it, the details are lost in following refactorings, no comments anywhere in code on why... It is what it is - again, unfortunately.\n\nNo, imho \"install.network.ovn|default\" can\u0027t be removed same as any code potentially used by released OSP\u003c17s. As we have close to zero tooling on IR coverage in CI, any decision like that might potentially change behaviour of CI for released OSP unpredictably, again the same argument from https://review.gerrithub.io/c/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/527832 .\n\nI defer to Tuvya as the latest commit owner for related code to provide more insight, but all things considered, this seems to me like the right solution for this case.",
